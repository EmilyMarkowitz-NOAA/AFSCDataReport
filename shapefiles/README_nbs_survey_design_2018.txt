The Northern Bering Sea (NBS) survey in 2018 was NOT a standard NBS survey, unlike those 
conducted in 2010 & 2017. The next standard NBS survey is planned for the summer of 2019. 

Survey Design and Analyses:
Stations in 2018 were 30 nautical miles apart (instead of 20 nm) and excluded Norton Sound 
and inshore areas above Nunivak Island. For comparison among years (2010, 2017, 2018), 
analyses truncated the areal coverage to encompass only the area covered in 2018, and a was
treated as a single stratum. This truncated area is 158,286 square kilometers (compared to 
200,207 square kilometers in 2010 & 2017).

See NBS_survey_design_10_17_18_trunc.pdf
for a diagram of the stations and area sampled.

Number of Stations in NBS truncated data-sets:
2010 n=108
2017 n=110
2018 n=49
